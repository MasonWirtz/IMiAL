MAY, 2023\n            \n            Dr. Kate Stone is a psycholinguist in the Cognitive\n            Neuroscience Lab at the University of Potsdam, Germany. Her\n            research interests are in probabilistic sentence processing\n            and how uncertainty and conflict affect readers’ linguistic\n            expectations. She uses EEG and computational modelling to\n            examine how these expectations unfold over time.\n            \n            Title and Abstract\n            \n            Analysing the timecourse of experimental effects\n            in eyetracking data\n            Tracking language users’ eyes as they read or listen\n            provides us with valuable insights into language cognition.\n            By analysing how the eyes move as new input is received, we\n            can make inferences about changes in cognitive processing. A\n            common question in language cognition research is about the\n            timing of these changes: for example, are non-native\n            listeners slower to comprehend particular types of sentences\n            than native speakers? If so, why? In this talk I will\n            discuss how reading eye tracking and the visual world\n            paradigm can be used for analysing the timecourse of\n            language processing. I will introduce our own method for\n            quantifying and comparing the onsets of experimental effects\n            in visual world data, and show how the method allowed us to\n            answer a question about why non-native speakers might be\n            slower to process particular types of syntactic cues.\n            Overall, the talk should give a broad overview of the issue\n            of timecourse analysis in eye tracking, as well as introduce\n            a specific timecourse analysis method with links to example\n            code and data.\n            \n            \n            \n            Dr. Yves Scherrer\n            Lecture Date: 25. MAY, 2023\n            Dr. Yves Scherrer a university lecturer in Language\n            Technology at the University of Helsinki, where he arrived\n            in March 2017 as a post-doctoral researcher. Prior to that,\n            he spent several years at the University of Geneva.\n            \n            Title and Abstract\n            \n            Neural machine translation for low-resource and\n            variation-rich languages\n            Current machine translation architectures are based\n            on deep neural networks and provide impressive translation\n            quality for the major language pairs. I will start by giving\n            a high-level overview of neural machine translation\n            architectures and then focus on two challenging application\n            scenarios.\n            The first scenario concerns low-resource languages. I\n            will present our participation in the AmericasNLP shared\n            task, which focuses on machine translation from Spanish to\n            eleven indigenous languages of the Americas. I describe how\n            a combination of techniques, ranging from data collection to\n            knowledge distillation and post-processing, helps improve\n            the translation quality.\n            In the second scenario, I investigate the suitability\n            of neural machine translation techniques for the automatic\n            normalization of phonetic transcriptions in multi-dialectal\n            corpora. In this case, our focus does not lie in optimal\n            normalization performance, but rather what the model learns\n            about the different dialects and their relation with each\n            other during the training process. In our case study with\n            large Finnish and Norwegian dialect corpora, the model\n            successfully identified the major dialect areas known from\n            prior dialectological research.\n            \n            \n            \n            Dr. Laura Rosseel\n            Lecture Date: 29. JUNE, 2023\n            \n            Dr. Laura Rosseel’s research interests mainly lie in the\n            fields of sociolinguistics, language variation and change,\n            and experimental linguistics. Her PhD research focused on\n            innovating the measurement of the social meaning of language\n            variation. More specifically, she studied on a number of\n            implicit attitude measures recently developed in social\n            psychology and investigated whether it is possible to adapt\n            these new attitude measures and use them to study language\n            attitudes. Laura’s dissertation comprised three studies in\n            which the Personalized Implicit Association Test (P-IAT) and\n            the Relational Responding Task (RRT) are used to measure\n            attitudes towards five varieties of Dutch: Standard Belgian\n            Dutch and four regional varieties of Colloquial Belgian\n            Dutch.\n            \n            Title and Abstract\n            \n            New approaches to measuring the social meaning of\n            language variation. The potential of the IAT and RRT for\n            sociolinguistics\n            \n            \n            \n            Dr. Pia Pichler\n            Lecture Date: 09. NOVEMBER, 2023\n            \n            Dr. Pia Pichler is Senior Lecturer in Linguistics and\n            Programme Convenor of the MA Sociocultural Linguistics in\n            the Department of English and Comparative Literature, at\n            Goldsmiths, University of London. Dr. Pichler’s research\n            focuses on the discursive construction of intersectional\n            identities in the spontaneous talk of young people, in\n            particular on intersections of language and gender with\n            social class, ethnicity and race, but also on indexicality,\n            humour, double-voicing and authenticity.\n            \n            Title and Abstract\n            \n            Analysing masculinities in spoken interaction:\n            intersectionality, indexicality and “voice”\n            In this talk I introduce a selection of approaches\n            that I have taken to the analysis of masculinities in my\n            work on the self-recorded, spontaneous talk of a group of\n            young men from ethnically and racially mixed working-class\n            backgrounds in southeast London.\n            I will introduce an interactional sociolinguistic\n            approach, informed by Bakhtin’s (1981; 1984; 1986) work on\n            dialogicality and Tannen’s (1989; 2004) notion of\n            constructed dialogue, which has allowed me to explore the\n            young men’s use of voices in relation to a range of\n            discourses which are shaped by and shape their\n            intersectional masculinities. Intersections of race,\n            ethnicity and social class inform many of the young men’s\n            positions, for example when they talk about their own\n            ‘overstanding’ of hip hop in relation to the mere\n            ‘understanding’ of ‘white kids from Oxford’, or when they\n            contrast their own experience of southeast London with that\n            of ‘Hipsters moving into the hood’. Another example is their\n            discussion of social inequality in the context of the ‘2011\n            London Riots’, where they consider their own position in\n            relation to rioters who resorted to ‘stealing rice from a\n            shop’ on one hand, and ‘people who don’t need shit […] they\n            go skiing in the Alps at Christmas’ on the other.\n            I will argue that for the analysis of the indexical\n            processes at the centre of the young men’s positioning we\n            need to consider the ‘microcontext of interaction’ in\n            relation to the ‘macrosociological order’ (Silverstein 2004:\n            638-639). Silverstein’s term ‘cultural concepts’ is useful\n            in this endeavour, as it allows us to consider how speakers\n            draw on words and expressions which index certain cultural\n            knowledge and constitute important resources for their\n            positioning. My presentation highlights the importance of\n            approaching the analysis of these indexical processes from\n            an intersectional approach and aims to provide insight into\n            how ‘subjects mobilise (or choose not to mobilise)\n            particular aspects of their identities in particular\n            circumstances’ (Nash 2008: 11).\n            References:\n            Bakhtin, Mikhail (1981) The dialogic imagination\n            (trans.

DECEMBER, 2023 / 15. DECEMBER, 2023\n            \n            JProf. Dr. Andreas Weilinghoff is a junior professor in\n            English linguistics at the University of Koblenz, the\n            youngest university in Germany. He has a passion for speech\n            and speech technology as well as for data processing and\n            analysis.\n            His research background is rooted in phonetics and\n            sociolinguistics, but there are very smooth transitions into\n            computer linguistics and corpus linguistics. One of his\n            major goals is to make the newest technology accessible and\n            usable for teaching and research. While there are many shiny\n            toys and exciting AI tools out there, it is still relatively\n            difficult to implement them effectively for different\n            projects.

Laura’s dissertation\n              comprised three studies in which the Personalized Implicit\n              Association Test (P-IAT) and the Relational Responding\n              Task (RRT) are used to measure attitudes towards five\n              varieties of Dutch: Standard Belgian Dutch and four\n              regional varieties of Colloquial Belgian Dutch.\n              \n              Title and Abstract\n              \n              New approaches to measuring the social meaning\n              of language variation.

Dr. Pichler’s research\n              focuses on the discursive construction of intersectional\n              identities in the spontaneous talk of young people, in\n              particular on intersections of language and gender with\n              social class, ethnicity and race, but also on\n              indexicality, humour, double-voicing and authenticity.\n              \n              Title and Abstract\n              \n              Analysing masculinities in spoken interaction:\n              intersectionality, indexicality and “voice”\n              In this talk I introduce a selection of approaches\n              that I have taken to the analysis of masculinities in my\n              work on the self-recorded, spontaneous talk of a group of\n              young men from ethnically and racially mixed working-class\n              backgrounds in southeast London.\n              I will introduce an interactional sociolinguistic\n              approach, informed by Bakhtin’s (1981; 1984; 1986) work on\n              dialogicality and Tannen’s (1989; 2004) notion of\n              constructed dialogue, which has allowed me to explore the\n              young men’s use of voices in relation to a range of\n              discourses which are shaped by and shape their\n              intersectional masculinities. Intersections of race,\n              ethnicity and social class inform many of the young men’s\n              positions, for example when they talk about their own\n              ‘overstanding’ of hip hop in relation to the mere\n              ‘understanding’ of ‘white kids from Oxford’, or when they\n              contrast their own experience of southeast London with\n              that of ‘Hipsters moving into the hood’. Another example\n              is their discussion of social inequality in the context of\n              the ‘2011 London Riots’, where they consider their own\n              position in relation to rioters who resorted to ‘stealing\n              rice from a shop’ on one hand, and ‘people who don’t need\n              shit […] they go skiing in the Alps at Christmas’ on the\n              other.\n              I will argue that for the analysis of the indexical\n              processes at the centre of the young men’s positioning we\n              need to consider the ‘microcontext of interaction’ in\n              relation to the ‘macrosociological order’ (Silverstein\n              2004: 638-639). Silverstein’s term ‘cultural concepts’ is\n              useful in this endeavour, as it allows us to consider how\n              speakers draw on words and expressions which index certain\n              cultural knowledge and constitute important resources for\n              their positioning. My presentation highlights the\n              importance of approaching the analysis of these indexical\n              processes from an intersectional approach and aims to\n              provide insight into how ‘subjects mobilise (or choose not\n              to mobilise) particular aspects of their identities in\n              particular circumstances’ (Nash 2008: 11).\n              References:\n              Bakhtin, Mikhail (1981) The dialogic\n              imagination (trans.
