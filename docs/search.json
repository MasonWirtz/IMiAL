More specifically, she studied on a number of\n            implicit attitude measures recently developed in social\n            psychology and investigated whether it is possible to adapt\n            these new attitude measures and use them to study language\n            attitudes.

Such advances are evident in, e.g., (a) the\n            launching of the Research Methods in Applied\n            Linguistics journal (edited by Shaofeng Li), (b) the\n            facilitation of replicability and reproducibility via open\n            materials, open data, and the availability of analyses on\n            databases such as IRIS and Open Science Framework (e.g., Liu\n            et al., in press), (c) the uptake in more complex data\n            analysis procedures such as Bayesian data analysis,\n            generalized additive modeling, and structural equation\n            modeling (e.g., Pfenninger & Neuser, 2020; Raeisi-Vanani\n            et al., 2022), and (d) the advocation of rigorous digital\n            approaches to data collection such as virtual reality (e.g.,\n            Peeters, 2019).
