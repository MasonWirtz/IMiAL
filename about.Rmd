## Dr. Laura Rosseel

Lecture Date: 29. JUNE, 202

Dr. Laura Rosseel's research interests mainly lie in the fields of sociolinguistics, language variation and change, and experimental linguistics. Her PhD research focused on innovating the measurement of the social meaning of language variation. More specifically, she studied on a number of implicit attitude measures recently developed in social psychology and investigated whether it is possible to adapt these new attitude measures and use them to study language attitudes. Lauraâ€™s dissertation comprised three studies in which the Personalized Implicit Association Test (P-IAT) and the Relational Responding Task (RRT) are used to measure attitudes towards five varieties of Dutch: Standard Belgian Dutch and four regional varieties of Colloquial Belgian Dutch.
